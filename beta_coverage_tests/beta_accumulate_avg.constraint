// Test Beta Join - AVG simulation (simplified)
type Employee : <id: string, name: string, department: string, salary: number>
type Performance : <id: string, employee_id: string, score: number, quarter: string>

{e: Employee, p: Performance} / e.department == "sales" AND p.employee_id == e.id AND p.score >= 8.5 ==> top_performer(e.id)
{e: Employee, p: Performance} / e.department == "engineering" AND p.employee_id == e.id AND p.score >= 9.0 ==> senior_engineer_candidate(e.id)
