feat(rete): Add OR expression handling with normalization and sharing

SUMMARY
=======
Implement comprehensive OR expression support in RETE engine.
OR expressions are now treated as single atomic AlphaNodes (not decomposed)
while being normalized to enable sharing between rules with different term orders.

FEATURES
========
✅ OR expressions create single AlphaNode (not decomposed into chains)
✅ OR normalization enables AlphaNode sharing between equivalent rules
✅ Mixed expressions (AND+OR) supported as single nodes
✅ Correct fact propagation through OR conditions
✅ Short-circuit evaluation for performance

IMPLEMENTATION
==============
Files Modified:
- rete/alpha_chain_extractor.go (+178 lines)
  * NormalizeORExpression() - extracts, sorts, rebuilds OR terms
  * normalizeORLogicalExpression() - handles constraint.LogicalExpression
  * normalizeORExpressionMap() - handles map format

- rete/constraint_pipeline_helpers.go (~40 lines)
  * Reorganize flow: handle OR/Mixed BEFORE CanDecompose() check
  * Call NormalizeORExpression() for ExprTypeOR and ExprTypeMixed
  * Create single AlphaNode with normalized condition

- rete/evaluator_constraints.go (~32 lines)
  * Improved evaluateConstraintMap() to handle LogicalExpression structures
  * Route to evaluateLogicalExpression() for proper OR evaluation

Files Created:
- rete/alpha_or_expression_test.go (641 lines, 5 tests)
  * TestOR_SingleNode_NotDecomposed ✅
  * TestOR_Normalization_OrderIndependent ✅
  * TestMixedAND_OR_SingleNode ✅
  * TestOR_FactPropagation_Correct ✅
  * TestOR_SharingBetweenRules ✅

DOCUMENTATION
=============
- ALPHA_OR_EXPRESSION_HANDLING.md (401 lines) - Complete technical guide
- LIVRAISON_OR_EXPRESSION.md (508 lines) - Delivery report
- OR_EXPRESSION_README.md (129 lines) - Quick reference
- OR_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md (403 lines) - Executive summary
- ALPHA_NODE_SHARING.md - Updated changelog (v1.2)

TESTS
=====
All tests passing: 5/5 (100%)
$ go test ./rete
ok  	github.com/treivax/tsd/rete	0.114s

EXAMPLE
=======
Before: Different order = different AlphaNodes
Rule1: p.status == "VIP" OR p.age > 18  → AlphaNode1
Rule2: p.age > 18 OR p.status == "VIP"  → AlphaNode2 (duplicate!)

After: Same AlphaNode shared (50% memory reduction)
Rule1: p.status == "VIP" OR p.age > 18  → AlphaNode_shared
Rule2: p.age > 18 OR p.status == "VIP"  → AlphaNode_shared ♻️

Hash (both): alpha_84ef332f520d58e7 (identical after normalization)

PERFORMANCE
===========
- Memory: Up to 50% reduction for shared OR nodes
- Evaluation: Short-circuit (stops at first true term)
- Sharing: Enabled via canonical term ordering

COMPATIBILITY
=============
✅ Backward compatible (no breaking changes)
✅ MIT License headers on all files
✅ Works with existing RETE features
✅ Integrates with LifecycleManager
